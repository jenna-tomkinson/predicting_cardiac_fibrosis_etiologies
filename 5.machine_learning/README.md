# Machine learning

In this module, we train machine learning models on different heart subtypes and all hearts together.
For all models, we hold out the heart #2 without any treatment (None/media) and one random well per heart.
Training and testing datasets are generated using 70/30 splitting.

## Perform machine learning on data

To perform machine learning on the dataset, run the bash script [run_machine_learning.sh](./run_machine_learning.sh) using the command below:

```bash
source run_machine_learning.sh
```
